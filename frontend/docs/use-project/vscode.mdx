# VSCode
VSCode is an open-source, cross-platform code editor developed by Microsoft. This guide will walk you through the process of building, running, and debugging generated CMake projects in VSCode.

## Building the Project
1. Open the project directory in VSCode.
2. **Install all recommended extensions.**
3. Open the command palette and execute `CMake: Select Configure Preset`, then select an option (e.g., `gcc`).
4. Open the command palette again and execute `CMake: Select Build Preset`, then select an option (e.g., `MinSizeRel`).
5. Execute `CMake: Build` (or press F7) to build the project.

## Running the Project
### With OpenOCD
:::tip
OpenOCD is an open-source tool that provides on-chip programming and debugging support. For most types of adapters (eg. CMSIS-DAP or ST-Link), OpenOCD is a good choice to drive them. However, a significant exclusion is J-Link adapter, which is recommended to use JLink GDB Server for better performance and advanced features.
:::

1. Edit `openocd.cfg` to configure OpenOCD, see [Configure OpenOCD](/docs/config-openocd) to learn more. The default configuration is for CMSIS-DAP debugger.
2. Open the command palette and execute `Tasks: Run Task`.
3. Choose `Download (OpenOCD)` to upload the program to the board.

## Debugging
### With OpenOCD
1. Edit `openocd.cfg` to configure OpenOCD, see [Configure OpenOCD](/docs/config-openocd) to learn more. The default configuration is for CMSIS-DAP debugger.
2. Open the Run and Debug Panel.
3. Select `Debug (OpenOCD)`.

### With JLink
1. Check the `.vscode/launch.json` file and correct the path of `serverpath`, eg. 
   ```json
   {
       "servertype": "jlink",
       "serverpath": "C:/Program Files/SEGGER/JLink/JLinkGDBServerCL.exe"
   }
   ```
2. Open the Run and Debug Panel.
3. Select `Debug (JLink)`.

### Configure Peripheral View
SVD files for command devices are pre-configured. Peripheral registers can be viewed in the Run and Debug panel.

Some devices may require manual configuration, download the SVD file from the manufacturer's website and edit `.vscode/launch.json` to use it.
```json
{
    "deviceName": "STM32F401CCUx",
    // highlight-next-line
    "svdPath": "${workspaceFolder}/path/to/STM32F401CCUx.svd"
}
```
