# Set Up the Build Environment
To build STM32 projects, a build environment must be set up. This environment includes the necessary compilers, libraries, and tools required to compile and flash the firmware to the microcontroller. The STM32Tesseract GUI provides a convenient way to set up this environment.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the build environment, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:
- A stable internet connection
- Sufficient disk space (approximately 1 GB)
- Administrator privileges

## Steps
1. Launch `stm32tesseract-gui`.
2. Navigate to the `Environment` tab.
3. Click `Up` to initiate the build environment setup.
4. The program will automatically download the necessary toolchain and configure the environment variables.
5. ***Restart your computer to activate the new environment variables.***

## FAQ
### How to troubleshoot download failure?
If the download fails, check your internet connection and try again. 

### How to configure a proxy server?
In some enterprise internal networks, you may need to configure a proxy server to download the necessary files.

STM32Tesseract would automatically detect and use the proxy server settings from the system environment variables. `http_proxy` and `https_proxy` are the environment variables that would be used by STM32Tesseract.
