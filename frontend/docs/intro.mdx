# Introduction
STM32Tesseract is a utility designed to seamlessly integrate STM32CubeMX-generated code with contemporary IDEs and build systems.

## Components
### CLI
This is the command-line interface designed for STM32Tesseract, allowing for direct and scriptable control via terminal commands.

## Motivation
While STM32CubeMX is an excellent tool for initializing STM32 projects, it often falls short in supporting modern, user-friendly toolchains. STM32Tesseract aims to bridge this gap, enhancing the development experience by facilitating integration with advanced IDEs and build systems.
